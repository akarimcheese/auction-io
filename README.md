Things to do now
- Make sure time left to bid reliably syncs between clients
- Fix layout so it looks nice on all browser sizes
- Remove user from leaderboard when they disconnect

Things to do sooner
- Figure out better time limit system
- Change bidding mechanism from inputting your own number to adding increments to current winning bid
- Implement client-side proxy bidding
- Add title and some information on login screen
- Create a mode for Independent Private Values
- Display user's score somewhere
- Figure out what image IDs are missing from unsplash.it
- Allow for 'hints' on item value (Either reveal value, # of digits, or specific digit)
- Create a mode for sealed bid first/second price auctions
- Create a mode for descending/ascending clock auctions
- Give each painting a randomly assigned name

Things to do later
- Multi-item auctions (sequential, simultaneous multiround, vickrey, perhaps incentive auction with past winnings)
- Chat room
- Allow user to see all won paintings
- Come up with a better scoring system
- Come up with some upgrades


Troll prevention
- Digit limit
- Prevent bids higher than max value
- Budget System. Start with budget, you get dividends for each round you participate in
